Bank Loan Report Dashboard
Tools Used: SQL, Tableau

Developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report dashboard to monitor and assess lending activities and performance. Utilized SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Tableau for data visualization. Key features include:

Calculated and visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).
Segmented KPIs into 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' for detailed performance analysis.
Created a grid view report by loan status, providing insights into metrics like MTD Funded Amount and Average DTI.
Implemented various chart types (line charts, filled maps, donut charts, bar charts, tree maps) to represent loan trends, regional analysis, loan terms, employment length, loan purposes, and home ownership.
This project enhanced data-driven decision-making and strategic planning by providing valuable insights into the bank's loan portfolio and lending trends.
